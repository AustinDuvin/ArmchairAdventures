A Unity3D Augmented Reality Roleplaying Game.  It is primarily intended to simulate the combat systems of tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Pathfinder.  Currently only runs on Android and the current state of the project does not reflect the intended final product, some of the UI exists primarily for me to test functionality.
